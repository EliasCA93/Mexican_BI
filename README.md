# Mexican_BI
Hi, welcome to Mexican_BI Git repository!.

I'm Elias Castellanos Alamilla, a mexican data enthusiast that enjoy the transformation process from tabular data to something more clear through data viz.
I want to create an open source data science project to analize the behavoir of key mexican economics indicators and some oil and gas features to create a complete scenario for general data consult.

# Goal
